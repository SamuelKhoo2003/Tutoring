# Python Homework

# Part 1: For Loops & Lists

# 1. Create a list of 5 fruits.
#    Use a for loop to print each fruit in the list.

# 2. Write a program that prints all even numbers between 1 and 20 using a for loop.

# 3. Given a list of numbers [3, 7, 2, 9, 4], use a for loop to calculate 
#    the sum of all numbers and print the result.


# Part 2: If-Else Statements

# 4. Ask the user to input a number.
#    - If the number is positive, print "Positive number".
#    - If the number is zero, print "Zero".
#    - If the number is negative, print "Negative number".

# 5. Write a program that checks if a given number is even or odd 
#    and prints a message accordingly.


# Part 3: While Loops

# 6. Write a program that keeps asking the user to enter a password 
#    until they type "python123". (Use a while loop.)

# 7. Create a simple counter that starts at 5 and counts down to 1 using a while loop.


# Part 4: 2D Arrays (Lists of Lists) - Challenge

# 8. Create a 2D list (matrix) like this:
#    matrix = [
#        [1, 2, 3],
#        [4, 5, 6],
#        [7, 8, 9]
#    ]

#    - Use nested loops to print all the elements in row-major order (left to right, top to bottom).
#    - Then, print only the elements on the diagonal (1, 5, 9).


# Bonus Challenge (Optional)

# 9. Modify the above matrix by adding 10 to each element and print the new matrix.
