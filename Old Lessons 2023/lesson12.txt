(11th November)
Question 1:
Write a Python function called reverse_list(my_list) that takes a list as input and returns a new list with the elements reversed.
Example:
original_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
reversed_list = reverse_list(original_list)
print(reversed_list)
Expected Output:
[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
NOTE: Ensure that your function works for lists of different lengths and types of elements

Question 2:
Error identification:
Identify and correct the errors in the following Python code:
def calculate_average(numbers):
    total = 0
    for num in numbers:
        total += num
    average = total / len(numbers)
    return average

numbers = [10, 15, 20, 25, 30]
result = calculate_average(numbers)
print("The average is: ", result)

Question 3:
Write a Python function called unique_elements(my_list) that takes a list as input and returns a new list containing only the unique elements in the same order as they appear in the original list.

Example:
original_list = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5]
unique_list = unique_elements(original_list)
print(unique_list)
Expected Output:
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
NOTE: Ensure that your function works for lists of different lengths and types of elements
