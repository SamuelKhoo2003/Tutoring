1. Write a Python function called reverse_rows(mygrid) that takes a 2D grid as input and returns a new grid where each row is reversed.
Example:
mygrid =  [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
# Original Grid:
# 1 2 3
# 4 5 6
# 7 8 9

# After calling reverse_rows(mygrid):
# Reversed Grid:
# 3 2 1
# 6 5 4
# 9 8 7


2. Design a class named person with the attributes of name, nickname and age, then can you write a sub class function called greeting which greets them and tells them their nickname and age. 

3. An extension is to add another sub function which checks if they are older or younger than age 21, printing 2 different outputs. 

HINTS for 2 and 3:
- remember to use the def __init__ to initialise values, don't forget to include the self aspect too to call values, e.g. self.name, etc etc
- when declaring functions remember to include them under the sub class and not outside of the class
