This homework continues on from our grid exercises, list indexing and for loops work from class!

1. Write a Python function called swap_first_last(mylist) that takes a list as input and returns a new list where the first and last elements are swapped.
e.g. this should be the expected output:
mylist = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
# Original List: [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]

# After calling swap_first_last(mylist):
# Swapped List: [50, 20, 30, 40, 10]

2. Write a function row_averages(mygrid) that returns a list containing the average value of each row in the grid. Remember to use doubles as the average might not be a whole number! Once this is done can you try doing it for col_averages too? Where you return a list containing the average value for each column within the grid. 

3. Write a function multiply_grid(mygrid, factor) that takes a grid (mygrid) and a factor as input and multiplies each element in the grid by that factor.
e.g. if mygrid is:
123
456
789
and the factor inputed in 2, we should return a new list of grid:
[[2, 4, 6], [8, 10, 12], [14, 16, 18]]
