Question 1:
Write a Python function called reverse_list(my_list) that takes a list as input and returns a new list with the elements reversed.
Example:
original_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
reversed_list = reverse_list(original_list)
print(reversed_list)
Expected Output:
[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
NOTE: Ensure that your function works for lists of different lengths and types of elements
