# GENERATE MULTIPLICATION TABLE
# Multiplication Table:
# Write a program to generate the multiplication table for a given number up to a specified range (e.g., 1 to 10).

# To start user input:
# The program begins by prompting the user to enter the following details:
# The number for which they want to generate the multiplication table.
# The start of the range (e.g., from where they want to start the table).
# The end of the range (e.g., where they want to end the table).

# The expected output would be:
# Multiplication Table for 5 (from 1 to 10):
# 5 x 1 = 5
# 5 x 2 = 10
# 5 x 3 = 15
# 5 x 4 = 20
# 5 x 5 = 25
# 5 x 6 = 30
# 5 x 7 = 35
# 5 x 8 = 40
# 5 x 9 = 45
# 5 x 10 = 50

1 to 7 for the number 7:
7 x 1 = 7
7 x 2 = 14
7 x 3 = 21

.
7 x 7 = 49
